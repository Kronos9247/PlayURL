This project won't be updated in the future



This is a extension for expression 2. Most functions from IGModAudioChannel are in the core. 
I hope the community had fun with this liddel thing. The importent functions are .... 

Var:playurl=playURL(string name, string url) 
Var:playurl:getFFT( number fft_enum ) -----> fft_enum are constant variables like _FFT_256, and so one 
Var:playurl:setVolume( number volume ) 
number=Var:playurl:isSetuped().
